# Restaurant Reservation Project: Thinkful Capstone

## Project Goals

### Capstone: Restaurant Reservation System

- You have been hired as a full stack developer at _Periodic Tables_, a startup that is creating a reservation system for fine dining restaurants.
- The software is used only by restaurant personnel when a customer calls to request a reservation.

### Tools Used

- Node.JS
- React
- React Hooks
- Express
- Knex
- PostgreSQL
- Bootstrap
- HTML5
- CSS
- Git

## Takeaways

- Version control with Git is key to staying organized and implementing features separate of one another.
- It can be easy to go off track when developing a full-stack application, using a Kanban is another key to success.
- When it comes to coding itself, no reason to overcomplicate things right away; write workable code first, and then look to streamline where possible.

## Final Thoughts

This was my first full-stack application built from little starter code. I was allowed the freedom to design the page how I felt best, all tests were functional rather than design oriented. It was a very rewarding feeling after each feature was implemented and worked; seeing the whole project come together made me really understand why people love developing and it fueled my desire to learn and grow even more.
